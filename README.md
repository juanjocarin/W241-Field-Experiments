# W241 Field Experiments

1. The importance of experimentation: reverse causality, sample selection
2. Comparing apples to apples: randomization and independence, potential outcomes
3. Quantifying uncertainty: sampling distributions, randomization inference, p-values, statistical power, confidence intervals
4. Blocking and clustering
5. Covariates and regression: randomization check (diagnostic), omitted-variable bias without randomization
6. Heterogeneous treatment effects
7. Incomplete control over treatment delivery: one-sided non-compliance, CACE vs. ATE
8. Spillovers
9. Causality from observational data: natural experiments (IV), difference in difference, regression discontinuity
10. Additional topics: (differential) attrition, mediation, generalization of Results, observation versus experiment, prediction versus inference, attempts to fix observational data (propensity scores, matching)


+ 5 problem sets and a final project (all using **R**): "[*Investigating the effect of competition on the ability to solve arithmetic problems*](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/juanjocarin/W241-Field-Experiments/raw/master/Final%20Project/FinalPaper_Soto-Neff-Carin-Tumuluri.pdf)."
    + A randomized controlled experiment in which 300+ participants were assigned to a control group or one of two test groups to evaluate the effect of competition (being compared to no one or someone better or worse).
